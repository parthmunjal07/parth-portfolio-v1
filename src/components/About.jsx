            <br />
            Well, I'm a CS undergrad currently in my first year from Haryana,
            India.
            <br />
            So lets begin with my journey. I had many hobbies at the time when I was in 8th-grade. I remember that I studied a bit of HTML and CSS for the first time.
            From there sparked a curiosity in tech world.
            <br />
            And guess what? I didn't do it afterwards. Why? Well we all are brought up in a society where we have to give boards and then if you want to get a good college there is JEE. So 11th and 12th went in that.
            <br />
            Did I get an IIT or NIT? Nah, I got a state govt. university (Not the best but not the worst). So there was nothing but to accept the truth.
            <br />
            But in contrary I got a new circle of friends who were as enthusiastic as me. Who wanted to learn and explore new things. 
            <br />
            So, I gave myself a fresh start. New people, new environment and most work on myself (self improvement)
